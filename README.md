Learn Reinforcement Learning (RL) from Scratch

A Reinforcement Learning (RL) task is about training an agent that interacts with its environment. The agent transitions between different scenarios of the environment, referred to as states, by performing actions. Actions, in return, yield rewards, which could be positive, negative or zero. The agentâ€™s sole purpose is to maximize the notion of cumulative reward over an episode, which is everything that happens between an initial state and a terminal state, where we decide the rewards which align with the tasks that we want to accomplish.
